A pre-work for Code The Dream advanced placement into React.js Fall 2025 course.

The app asks the user for the coffee they want(hot or iced), then the app displays all the available option and asks the user to choose one. When a type of coffee is selected, the app displays the ingredients and description about the coffee.

The coffee is free! I chose this program because I am a coffee lover and traveling to Huila and Bogota in Colombia to learn about coffee has opened my eyes to how much coffee is important but a bit expensive.

To help people access coffee even when they don't have money. My main target is poor families who work tirelessly for minimum wages. They will have constant supply of coffee to keep them awake and enrgetic throughout the day.

I have used the SampleAPI/coffee API to render the information I needed about coffee. NOTE: data is only fetched when the coffee type is selected to avoid unnecessary requests.

The app fetches the titles of the coffee from the API and display them after the user have decided if they want hot or iced coffee. With that, the user have to select which coffee they want from the displayed titles. After that, the app fetches and display description and ingredients of the selected coffee, together with its title on a card.

NOTE: I didn't display coffee images because I wanted to keep the app simple and smooth.

NAVIGATION: The user can use a BACK TO COFFEE TYPE button to go back to selecting either hot or iced coffee.
